# MASPHL-Clin-Micro

## Overview
Analyses were conducted for the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory's Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. The laboratory receives clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens for routine monitoring, outbreak investigation, and sendout to the CDC.

As the Microbiology Division's Research Analyst, I was responsible for cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing laboratory output such as test volumes, turnaround times, and organism determination, as well as for communicating results to MASPHL and MassDPH personnel. 

## Major Projects
- _Internal Reporting_: Regular reporting of results for in-lab use.
  - _Clinical Microbiology Monthly Report_- Summary of isolates received and results for the current year, updated monthly. Included test volumes, percent positivity, and turnaround times by organism. Includes comparison of volumes and positivity rate between current year and past year.
  - _Clinical Microbiology Monthly Serotype Report_- Summary of positivity rate and found serotype by organism, updated monthly. Includes comparison of YTD with prior 2 years.
- _External Reporting_: Regular reporting of results for external partners.
  - _ELC Grant Application_- Compiled test volumes and TATs for Clinical Microbiology and Whole Genome Sequencing isolates to assist in MASPHL's appication for CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) Funding.
  - _OutbreakNet Enhanced Metrics_- Reported key metrics susch as test volumes, positivity rates, and TATs of enteric isolates for CDC OutbreakNet
- _Miscellaneous Projects_: Coded other, smaller projects for scientific abstracts, external reporting, and troubleshooting.
